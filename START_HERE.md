## 🧪 How Thinking Mode Works

When you ask a question:

1. **You send message** → Message appears in blue bubble
2. **Typing indicator shows** → Three bouncing dots (● ● ●)
3. **AI thinks internally** → Uses "thinking tokens" (you don't see this!)
4. **Response appears** → Clean answer in gray bubble

**What you DON'T see:**
- Internal thinking process
- Reasoning steps (unless AI includes them in answer)
- Technical metadata

**What you DO see:**
- Typing indicator (like Messenger)
- Final polished response
- Clean chat experience

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Configuration
```javascript
Model: gemini-2.5-pro
Endpoint: /v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent
API Key: AIzaSyD2Oxjw65jnQ_oDFG8sc6DbrdWghygr6Cg
```

### Thinking Mode Implementation
```javascript
// API returns both thinking metadata AND output
{
  candidates: [{
    content: {
      parts: [{
        text: "This is the answer"  // ← We show this
      }]
    }
  }],
  usageMetadata: {
    thoughtsTokenCount: 1234  // ← We hide this
  }
}
```

### Response Extraction
```javascript
// We extract only the visible text:
const response = data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;

// We ignore the thinking metadata:
// (thoughtsTokenCount is not displayed)
```
