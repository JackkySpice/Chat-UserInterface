## 🔧 render.yaml Configuration

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: gemini-chat-interface
    runtime: static
    buildCommand: echo "No build required - static site"
    staticPublishPath: .
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_VERSION
        value: 18
    headers:
      - path: /*
        name: X-Frame-Options
        value: SAMEORIGIN
      - path: /*
        name: X-Content-Type-Options
        value: nosniff
      - path: /*
        name: Referrer-Policy
        value: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
