# Chat History & Scrolling Features

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Full Chat History with localStorage**
- All messages (user and AI) are now saved to browser's localStorage
- Chat history persists even after closing the browser
- History is automatically loaded when you reopen the chat
- Clear chat option removes both display and saved history

### 2. **Proper Scrolling Functionality**
- **Free Scrolling**: You can now scroll up and down freely through all messages
- **Backread Support**: Scroll up to read previous messages without any interference
- **Smart Auto-Scroll**: New messages only auto-scroll if you're already near the bottom
- **Manual Scroll Detection**: If you scroll up to read old messages, new messages won't force you to the bottom
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Native smooth scroll behavior for better UX

### 3. **Visual Scroll Indicators**
- **Enhanced Scrollbar**: More visible scrollbar (8px width) with hover effects
- **Scroll Gradient**: Subtle gradient appears at top when scrolled down
- **Scroll-to-Bottom Button**: Floating button appears when not at bottom
- **Active State Feedback**: Visual feedback when scrolling

### 4. **Scroll-to-Bottom Button**
- Appears when you scroll up away from the bottom
- Click to quickly jump back to the latest messages
- Auto-hides when you're at the bottom
- Smooth scroll animation

### 5. **Touch-Optimized**
- Smooth touch scrolling on mobile devices
- Proper momentum scrolling with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- Touch gestures work naturally for scrolling
- Optimized for iOS and Android devices

## How It Works

### Scrolling Behavior:
1. **When you send a message**: Automatically scrolls to bottom
2. **When AI responds**: 
   - If you're at the bottom → auto-scrolls to show new response
   - If you've scrolled up → stays where you are (doesn't interrupt reading)
3. **Manual scrolling**: Works freely in both directions
4. **Scroll-to-bottom button**: Appears when not at bottom, click to return

### History Persistence:
- Messages saved after each send/receive
- Loads automatically on page refresh
- Survives browser restarts
- Clear chat removes everything

## Usage

### To Read Old Messages:
1. Simply scroll up to view previous conversation
2. The chat won't auto-scroll while you're reading
3. Click the scroll-to-bottom button to return to latest messages

### To Clear History:
1. Click the trash icon in the header
2. Confirm the action
3. All messages and saved history will be removed
